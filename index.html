        <p><b> 1 internet backbone is the core of the internet where the largest and fastest networks are interconected.</b></p>
        <p>2 a client sends requests while a server receives and responds to requests.</p>
        <p>3 a switch connects differant devices, routers connect networks to eachother and devices to networks, servers provide services for other devices, most other hardware components just communicate with one another.</p>
        <p>4 The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received</p>
        <p>5 web servers that handle http requests, online games, and email services.</p>
        <p>6 hypertext is text that contains a hyperlink.</p>
        <p>7 the web is related to the internet because the web is made up of tons of interconected pages and websites and the internet is interconected devices.</p>
        <p>8 HTTP functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server model</p>
        <p>9 HTTP doesn't encript information as it is sent from the server to the system, while HTTPS does encript information.</p>
        <p>10 web 1.0 was originaly defined by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 providing mainly static web pages with limited interactivity. web 2.0 was a new era with websites having more responsiveness. web 3.0 is the third and current generation currently being a work in progress, it is an idea for a decentralized and open web with more resourcefulness for users</p>
        <p>11 web 1.0 was mainy about static pages web 2.0 introduced more interactivity and web 3.0 added ontop of web 2.0 adding even more interactivity and having more openness.</p>
        <p>12 markup langauges have allowed for many websites to arise and allow for easier creation of text based documents</p>
        <p>13 markup languages control the presentation of data while a scripting language is used to mediate between programs in ordeer to generate data.</p>
        <p>14 the markup languages are mostly child languages, being related because they have the same base.</p>
        <p>15 coding and gaming are areas of interest for me and, i believe technology can be used to better the world, i have access to many resources, and have learned some coding prior to taking this course</p>
        <p>16 CSE1210 may connect me to future ocupactions in web development</p>
